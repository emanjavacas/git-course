* Getting started

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- This is [[https://emanjavacas.github.io][me]].

- And these are [[https://www.github.com/emanjavacas/git-course][materials for the course]].

** Get git

Follow the instructions for your OS [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][here]].

** [Optionally/Alternatively] install a Git client 

See [[https://www.github.com/emanjavacas/git-course][Materials for the course]] for links to different possibilities.


* About Git

** What is git?

"Git is a free and *open source distributed version control system* designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency" ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29][Wikipedia]])
   
#+REVEAL: split

A Version Control System (VCS) is a methodology or tool that...

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
 - helps you *keep track of changes* you make to the files in your project
 - and allows you to *communicate and synchronize your changes* with other people.
   # 

*** History

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Developed by Linux Torvalds as a means to enable the development of the Linux Kernel     
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - [[https://www.linux.com/blog/10-years-git-interview-git-creator-linus-torvalds][Interview with occassion of Git's 10th Year Anniversary]]
  - Inspired by BitKeeper (Distributed VCS that isn't open source)

- Relatively recent in the ecosystem of VCS tools
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - [[https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290][First git's commit 2005]]
  - Its main feature being that it is a *distributed* or *decentralized* system

# Originally, these repositories were accessible only if you were logged
# directly into the machines they were stored on. tools such as CVS, and
# later Subversion, were created. They allowed developers to work remotely
# from the repository and send their changes back using a network connection.

# These systems follow a centralized repository model. That means there
# is one central repository that everyone sends their changes to. Each
# developer keeps a copy of the latest version of the repository, and when-
# ever they make a change to it, they send that change back to the main
# repository.

# Instead of having one central repository that
# you and everyone else on your team sends changes to, you each have
# your own repository that has the entire history of the project. Making
# a commit doesnâ€™t involve connecting to a remote repository; the change
# is recorded in your local repository.

# Developers can have access to send the changes directly to the main
# repository (an action called pushing in Git), or they might have to
# submit patches, which are small sets of changes, to the project's maintainer
# and have them update the main repository.

# A centralized system is like having one bank that every developer on your team uses.
# A distributed system is like each developer having their own personal bank.

# Differences:
# ------------
# No need of internet connection for development
# Easy branching
# No need to set commit access policies

*** Why you need it?

 #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
 - Because it is used by instructors in the study programme.
 - Because the need for collaborative tools is increasing and VCS are most powerful.

*** VCS vs. Collaborative Text Editors (GoogleDocs, etc.)

Synchronized vs Asynchronized Solutions to the problem of collaborative editing.

#+REVEAL: split
*Collaborative Text Editors*
#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Pros
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - Fast, real-time incorporation of changes.

- Cons
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - Impossible to work offline
  - No guarantees that change history reflects the real sequence of changes

#+REVEAL: split
*VCS*
#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Pros
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - Documented change history
  - Unlimited in terms of participants

- Cons
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - Steep learning curve

*** Take-away message

    Trade-off between and simplicity.
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Currently, we are mostly at one very end.
    #+END_NOTES

** What is not ~git~?

*** ~git~ vs GitHub

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- "GitHub is a web-based *Git repository hosting service*, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features." ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub][Wikipedia]]) (but there are others, see BitBucket).

*** A backup system

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- While you could use ~git~/GitHub for backing up, it *cannot handle large/binary files very well*.

* Basic Git Concepts

Let's introduce a bit of vocabulary (Last bit of me talking alone!)

# Double indent to avoid showing up in toc
*** Repository
    All git-tracked files in your project plus the full history of changes (commits and branches).

#+reveal: split
**** Types of Repository
     #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
     - *Local*
       Repository hosted in your current machine, to which you can make changes.
     - *Remote*
       Repository hosted in a different machine, to which you have access from your current machine.

*** Commit
    A snapshot including changes to previous states of the repository.

*** Branch
    Any of the parallel states in the repository (a particular commit history).

*** Working Tree
    Your current view of the project. You can always switch to a previous state of the project (state after a given commit), or a parallel state of the project (branch).

#+reveal: split
   - Statuses:
     - Clean: Up to date with git internal change log.
     - Dirty: Changes in your local copy are not tracked yet.

   - How to change the working tree:
     - Making a change & commiting
     - Moving to another (possibly new) branch (A.K.A. ~checkout~)
     - etc...

* Hands-on Tutorial

** Create your own repository
# Objective: initialize a repository, and set a remote on GitHub
For this tutorial, we are going to create a (very basic) resume homepage.

#+REVEAL: split
First we need Download a template

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
- Google for `free html resume template`
- Pick one from [[http://trendytheme.net/20-best-free-html-resume-templates-to-download/][here]]
- Download the one I picked from [[https://www.github.com/emanjavacas/resume/archive/v0.0.zip][here]].

*** Create the remote repository (GitHub)

...

*** Using the Command Line

**** Initialize the repository

#+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
~git init~

**** Set the remote
~git remote add origin /path/to/remote/repo/~

*** Using GitHub Desktop
Snapshot

**** Create a repository

** Commit changes
# Objective: Do some local changes, commit and push

** Merging
# Objective: automerging, manual merging from the remote

** Branching
# Creating a branch, and merging branches

* Goodie

- If you change the name of your repository to ~username.github.io~, you can get your own personal page served by GitHub
- More info about GitHub Pages [[https://pages.github.com/][here]].
