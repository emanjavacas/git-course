- Embedded in your text editor (via plugins, etc.):
  - [Sublime Text: GitSavvy](https://github.com/divmain/GitSavvy), text based interface to git. Quite complete.
  - [Sublime Text: Git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git), access to git through an embedded command line. Very thin wrapper.

#### Repository ####
All VCS-tracked files in your project plus the full history of changes (commits) and branches.

#### Working tree ####
Your current view of the project. You can always switch to a previous state of the project (state after a given commit), or a parallel state of the project (branch).

#### Commit ####
A snapshot including changes to previous states of the repository.

#### Branch ####
Any of the parallel states in the repository (a particular commit history).
